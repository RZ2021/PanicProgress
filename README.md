# PanicProgress
A program to help writers get more done!

As someone who writes a lot, both creatively and academically, I have some trouble starting. Staring at a blank page is always the most challenging part of writing for me.
I decided to create a program that would help me with that. With creative writing, my best friend and I have little competitions to see who can write more words in
a certain amount of minutes. We'd set a timer and write as much as we could. We found out by accident that when we had her sister set timers, and we had no idea how
long they were going to be, we ended up writing way more than we normally did. I started calling them panic timers, which led me to name this program Panic Progress
since I was looking for more ways to motivate myself. 

What started as creating a program that would set random timers for me turned into way more. This program now includes five different modes (including the surprise
timers) and a game mode with your character fighting monsters across the land using words. The pen is mightier than the sword, after all!

This program is one of the first I ever wrote when I realized how much I loved C# almost a year ago. I cleaned it up and added a few new features since then, but it still
uses WinForms and doesn't have a database. I'd like to come back and add a database later, instead of the textfile for user information it uses. I'm also not particularly
skilled with graphics, all images I used are copyright-free, and while not the greatest, they do well for their purpose. For now, I'm happy with how this simple program 
turned out, considering how much I knew back when I first started with C#.

Features:
Five different modes to free write to
  - Word Count Goal: The user sets a word count goal they wish to complete and watch as their progress bar fills up the more they write.
  - Surprise Timer: The user can set a range of time in minutes (for example, from 2-10 minutes), and a timer will be set to a random time within that range.
  - Eraser Mode: If the user stops writing for twenty seconds, a certain amount of letters will be deleted from their writing until they start writing again. 
  - Distraction Mode: The user tries to write while various parts of the interface move, change size, change color, and much more. 
  - Ghost Mode: Users must write while their words flicker in and out of view like a ghost!
  
 Word Play:
  - A writing game that takes the user and their character across a writing themed land to battle monsters with their words. Different levels have different requirements 
    as they go. The difficulty of each level continues to go up as well. I plan to add more maps and levels in the future.
